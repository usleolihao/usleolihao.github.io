A magical documentation site generator.

#### What it is

docsify generates documentation website on the fly. Unlike GitBook, it does not generate static html files. Instead, it smartly loads and parses Markdown files and displays them as a website. To start using it, all you need to do is create an **index.html** and [deploy it on GitHub Pages](https://docsify.js.org/#/deploy).
