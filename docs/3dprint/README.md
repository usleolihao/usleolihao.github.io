[ðŸ‘‰Buy Flydigi Wasp Series Mobile Game Controller for iPad HereðŸ‘ˆ](https://www.amazon.com/Flydigi-One-Handed-Compatible-Connection-Controller/dp/B07VWVQ28C/ref=sr_1_3?crid=RNJQRUGKUW67&dchild=1&keywords=flydigi+wasp+2&qid=1612484847&sprefix=flydig+wasp%2Caps%2C214&sr=8-3)

The Flydigi wasp2 has the version for the phones. Since I would like to use it both with phones and pads, I built this extender for **iPhone 12Pro**, that also compatible with **iPhone 12**. It is an extender for the Flydigi Wasp2 iPad series.
